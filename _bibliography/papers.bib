  abstract={Density-based clustering is well-known for finding clusters that have different shapes and sizes, but they have unsatisfactory results on adjacent clusters with different densities. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that combines DBSCAN with centroid-based algorithms to address this issue. Our algorithm uses DBSCAN to form mini-clusters, which will be merged based on their density and center distances. We test the new algorithm on synthetic and real datasets to show the significant improvement in the results.},
