books_intro_paragraph: This section includes books that cover a wide range of topics in machine learning. Some of these books are introductory, while others are more advanced. 
  I have also included books that are not directly related to machine learning but are still relevant to the field. 
  I have organized the books by their publication year, from newest to oldest. 
  I have also included the author(s) of each book, as well as the edition number, if applicable. 
  I have also included the front cover of each book, if available. 

courses_intro_paragraph: This section includes courses that cover a wide range of topics in machine learning. Similar to the books section, some of these courses are introductory, while others are more advanced. I have organized the courses by their publication year, from newest to oldest. This section is still under construction, and I will move more courses from my GitHub repository to this page soon.

  This page compiles a collection of high-quality and free resources on machine learning that I have curated from diverse sources. 
  It is my pleasure to share these resources with you, as they can offer valuable insights to anyone interested in this intriguing field. 
  It is important to note that I am <b>NOT</b> the author of any of the content on this page, I do <b>NOT</b> claim any ownership over it, and I do <b>NOT</b> intend to profit from it, and I am <b>NOT</b> hosting any of the content on this page on my own servers and all of the content is hosted on the original author's servers.
  However, I have ensured that each resource is relevant, reliable, and informative. 
  Whether you are a novice or an experienced data scientist, I hope you will discover valuable materials here. 
  The list originally started as a <a href="https://github.com/mirerfangheibi/Machine-Learning-Resources">GitHub repository</a>
    , but I have developed this page to replace it to enhance readability. 
  Please check back regularly for newly added content. Moreover, if you have any suggestions for new resources, please do not hesitate to contact me.
  Let us explore the realm of machine learning together!
