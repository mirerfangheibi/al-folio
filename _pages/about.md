Currently, I am a Data Scientist at [ReelData](https://www.reeldata.ai), mainly solving computer vision problems. Previously, I was a Master of Computer Science student at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Sageev Oore](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~oore/). I was also affiliated with [Vector institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai). I obtained my B.Sc. from [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en) in 2017 and my M.Sc. from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) in 2019, both in Computer Engineering.
