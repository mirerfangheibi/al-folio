I am a Data Scientist at [ReelData AI](https://www.reeldata.ai), where I work on improving the capabilities of [ReelAppetite](https://www.reeldata.ai/reelAppetite), a machine learning system designed for auto-feeding land-based aquaculture, which minimizes waste and promotes sustainable food production. Prior to joining ReelData AI, I completed my Master's in Computer Science at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html), with a focus on machine learning under the supervision of [Dr. Sageev Oore](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~oore/). During my time at Dalhousie, I was also affiliated with both the [Vector institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and [DeepSense](https://deepsense.ca/). Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from the University of [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en) in 2017. In 2019, I pursued another Master's degree in Computer Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/), where my research focused on computation acceleration on parallel computing systems.
